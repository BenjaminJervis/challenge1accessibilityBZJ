# Project name: Challenge 1: make the website more accessible 

For this challenge we were given an example website made by Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. We were asked to make the website more accessible so that it was suitable for all users including those who are partially sighted or have some other form of disability. 
Accessibility in web design is extremely important and all websites should be made so that they can be easily accessed. 

# General information 

The aim of the project was to make the code we were given more accessible to all users. The purpose was to allow all users access the web page including those with disabilities to be able to so. 
By cleaning up the code we were given my aim was allow this to happen. 

# Technology Used

To complete this challenge I used the following technologies:
GitHub
GitBash
Visual Studio 

# Screenshots 

The screenshots I took can be accessed here ![screenshots of code that I changed](challenge1accessibilityBZJ/assets/screenshots.html)

# Set Up
Firstly I went to git hub and created a new repository on my GitHub account and clone it to your computer. I did this for a number of reasons, the first being so I could work on the code locally and make changes. I coud then commit these changes back to GitHub and finally so I could share my finished project. 
As I made my changes I took screen shots to document them and used `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
The requirements asked me to this several times so I have made 8 commits including 6 major changes. 
When I began to start working on the challenge I decided to change the name of the website. This was to reflect the fact that the website I was working on was part of the accessibility challenge. I then tried to go through the CSS code and I deleted 
one of the two H1 tags that I saw and changed that to H2 because no website should have 2 H1 tags because heading tags must be in sequential order for good accessibility. 
My motivation was always to try and improve the code so the product would be better for the user but as I have got limited knowledge I found it difficult and might not have achieved all my aims. 
I added alt tags to all the images and icons so that there was a short concise description of the image/icon incase they did not load. This was done to let people know that there is an image and it should be displayed when viewed in the web browser. 
I added nav tags and section tags to try and devide the page into regions as this is considered to aid accessibility. I moved the footer to H2 and then used <!--->
to hide this code. 

# Project Status 
This project is now complete 

# Room for improvement 
If i was doing this again I would make the text more contrastible with the background to make it stand out.
