# Title Challenge 1: make the website more accessible 

## what were we required to do?

For this challenge we were given an example website made by Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. We were asked to make the website more accessible so that it was suitable for all users including those who are partially sighted or have some other form of disability. 
Accessibility in web design is extremely important and all websites should be made so that they can be easily accessed. 
The website https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility states that The Web must be accessible to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Indeed, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right.
Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as older people, people in rural areas, and people in developing countries.
Accessibility also benefits people without disabilities. The Web Accessibility Perspectives video shows examples of how accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for everyone in a variety of situations.
There is also a strong business case for accessibility. Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization (SEO). Case studies show that accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach, among other benefits. Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization details the benefits of web accessibility.


## What did I do? 

Firstly I went to git hub and created a new repository on my GitHub account and clone it to your computer. I did this for a number of reasons, the first being so I could work on the code locally and make changes. I coud then commit these changes back to GitHub and finally so I could share my finished project. 

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

For the purposes of this challenge I have chosen to use a mit license so that it can be viewed and edited by others.
